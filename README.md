SLatLon
=================

An Objective-C port of the Latitude/longitude spherical geodesy formulae & scripts by Chris Veness. Read more about it here: [http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html](http://www.movable-type.co.uk/scripts/latlong.html)

The port is not complete yet though. I've only ported those that are currently of use to me. Feel free to fork and add more =) This could also use some unit tests.
